# Business_Insights
This project focuses on implementing Power BI at AtliQ Hardware to drive data-driven decision-making and optimize performance across finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain operations.

üåü Challenge: Atliq Technologies, a leading electronics firm, struggled with data analysis due to reliance on Excel files and was looking for an efficient solution for their business insights.

üåü Objective: Using Power BI, I aimed to transform approximately 2 million rows of records into actionable insights, enhancing decision-making across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive sectors.

üåü Tools Utilized: MySQL, Power BI Desktop, Excel, DAX Studio.

üåü Data Modeling Approach: Snowflake Schema for a scalable data model.

üåü Key Metrics Analyzed:
- Sales Performance: Gross Sales, Net Invoice Sales, Net Sales.
- Profitability: Net Profit, Gross Margin, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
- Deductions: Pre-Invoice and Post-Invoice Deductions.
- Error Metrics: Net Error, Absolute Net Error.
- Forecasting: Year to Date (YTD), Year to Go (YTG), Forecast Accuracy.

üåü Skills & Techniques Applied:
- Data Transformation and Loading: Efficiently handled large datasets using Power Query and DAX.
- Advanced Data Modeling: Implemented robust data models and calculated columns.
- Dynamic Visualizations: Created interactive dashboards with dynamic titles, bookmarks, and toggle buttons.
- KPI Implementation: Developed and visualized key performance indicators.
- Report Optimization: Enhanced performance by disabling unnecessary loads and validating data accuracy.

üåü Dashboards:
- üíπ Finance Dashboard: Get P&L statements for any customer/product/country or aggregation of the above over any time period and more.
- üí∞ Sales Dashboard: Analyze the performance of your customers over key metrics like Net Sales, and Gross Margin, and view the same in profitability/growth matrix.

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
- In this project, we have followed the Snowfall data modeling method.

### Dataset **Understanding.**

Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get a good understanding of what are data available.

Dimension table: It will have static data like details of customers and products

Fact table: It will have the data about the transactions

        - This table is used to forecast the customer‚Äôs needs in advance, which can help in
            - Higher customer satisfaction
            - Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purposes
        - The table is denormalized by the data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.
        - All the dates of the month will be replaced by the start date of the month
        - It will have all the column names and in the end, it will have the forecast quantity needed of the customer
    - fact_sales_monthly
        - This table is more or less is same as the fact_forecase_monthly table, but the last column has the value of the sold quantity instead of the forecast value.
